      "assistant: Agents in MetaGPT share information through a structured communication protocol that includes a shared message pool where agents publish structured messages. They can also subscribe to relevant messages based on their profiles. This approach enhances role communication efficiency and allows agents to obtain directional information from other roles and public information from the environment. Additionally, MetaGPT implements a publish-subscribe mechanism that enables agents to exchange information effectively within the multi-agent system. Agents also review previous feedback and make necessary adjustments to their constraint prompts before each project, continuously learning from past experiences to enhance the overall multi-agent system. Additionally, there is a structured workflow where different roles like Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, Engineer, and QA Engineer collaborate by sharing information in a sequential manner to ensure efficient communication and collaboration within the system.\n"
